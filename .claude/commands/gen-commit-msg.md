description: Generate a git commit message based on staged changes
---

Your task is to help the user to generate a commit message and commit the changes using git.

## Guidelines

- DO NOT add any ads such as "Generated with Claude Code"
- Only generate the message for staged files/changes
- Don't add any files using `git add`. The user will decide what to add.
- Follow the rules below for the commit message.

## Format

<type>:<space><message title>

<bullet points summarizing what was updated>

## Example Titles

feat(auth): add JWT login flow
fix(ui): handle null pointer in sidebar
refactor(api): split user controller logic
docs(readme): add usage section

## Rules

- title is lowercase, no period at the end.
- Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
- Use the body (optional) to explain *why*, not just *what*.
- Bullet points should be concise and high-level.

## Allowed Types

| Type | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| feat | New feature |
| fix | Bug fix |
| chore | Maintenance (e.g., tooling, deps) |
| docs | Documentation changes |
| refactor | Code restructure (no behavior change) |
| test | Adding or refactoring tests |
| style | Code formatting (no logic change) |
| perf | Performance improvements |
